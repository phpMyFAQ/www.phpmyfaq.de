In the last couple of weeks we decoupled our almost 14 year old website into variuous side projects to improve the maintainability of our infrastructure. The new page is completely revamped from the ground and was developed with the "mobile first" paradigm in mind. The new page is built using Yeoman, Grunt, Bower, Assemble and Handlebars, more and more content is just stored just as plain Markdown files. It's a static site which will be "assembled" during deployment. We also improved our URL structure. We hope, you like it. If you want to check the code, it's open source, grab it
