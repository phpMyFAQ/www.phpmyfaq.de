The new page is built using Yeoman, Grunt, Bower, Assemble and Handlebars, more and more content is just stored just as plain Markdown files. It's a static site which will be "assembled" during deployment. We also improved our URL structure. We hope, you like it. If you want to check the code, it's open source, grab it
