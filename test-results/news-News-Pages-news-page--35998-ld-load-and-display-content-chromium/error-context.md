          - paragraph [ref=e136]: We're excited to unveil phpMyFAQ 4.0.0-alpha, marking a significant milestone as we celebrate its 23rd Birthday! With this release, we've raised the bar, now requiring PHP 8.2 or later, ensuring compatibility with the latest advancements in the PHP ecosystem. Moreover, we've revamped the rewrite rules for both Apache and nginx. In terms of structure, we've reorganized the folder layout. As we continuously evolve, we're also laying the groundwork for future enhancements with the addition of Twig as our new template engine, promising more flexibility and efficiency in rendering dynamic content. Additionally, we're thrilled to introduce Symfony Routing for powerful routing capabilities to manage URL routing effortlessly. Administrators will rejoice with the introduction of a revamped admin configuration frontend, offering a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. Category management receives a substantial upgrade, now boasting full drag and drop sorting support for effortless organization. We've also redesigned the FAQ management frontend, providing administrators with more control and efficiency in managing frequently asked questions. Not stopping there, we've introduced the ability to sort sticky FAQs, providing finer control over content prioritization. Furthermore, we've added the flexibility to enable or disable cookie consent. Administrators will find joy in our experimental online update feature, providing a streamlined process for keeping phpMyFAQ up to date with the latest enhancements and fixes. Developers will appreciate the introduction of REST API v3.0, opening up new possibilities. To further streamline deployment, we've included Kubernetes manifest samples, making it easier than ever to deploy phpMyFAQ in a containerized environment. Additionally, we're excited to introduce experimental support for importing FAQs from CSV, offering a convenient way to migrate content from external sources. Administrators can now export user sessions to CSV format for further analysis and insights. In this release, we bid farewell to Twitter/X support, as well as the ability to add custom meta-content in templates, streamlining the codebase for improved maintainability and performance. We've also made significant improvements under the hood, migrating from Yarn to PNPM for package management and transitioning from Fork Awesome to Bootstrap Icons for better iconography support. Leveraging the latest language features of PHP 8.2, we've optimized the codebase for performance and maintainability. Lastly, we've updated PHPUnit to version 11, ensuring robust testing capabilities for developers. With phpMyFAQ 4.0.0-alpha, we're setting the stage for a more powerful, flexible, and user-friendly experience, paving the way for even greater innovations in the future. Please don't use this version in production systems, but test this version and please report bugs!
