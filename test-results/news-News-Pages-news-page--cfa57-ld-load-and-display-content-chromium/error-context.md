We removed the broken link verification, the translation frontend for users and the experimental large permissions support with sections. We migrated from SwiftMailer to Symfony Mailer, and we also refactored our codebase to use PHP 8.1 language features. Additionally, we updated to Bootstrap v5.3 and bundled TinyMCE v6.7.
