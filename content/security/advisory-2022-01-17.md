## Multiple CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities in phpMyFAQ

  **Issued on::** 2022-01-17
  **Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 3.0.9
  **Risk::** Medium
  **Platforms::** all

The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of some security issues that have been discovered in phpMyFAQ 3.0.9 and
  earlier. phpMyFAQ contains multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

## Description
phpMyFAQ does not implement sufficient checks to avoid

<ul>
  <li>XSS in the administration section when deleting meta data by an admin user,</li>
  <li>CSRF when toggling open questions by an admin user,</li>
  <li>CSRF when truncating search terms by an admin user,</li>
  <li>CSRF when logging out an admin user.</li>
</ul>

## Solution
The phpMyFAQ Team has released the new phpMyFAQ version 3.0.10 which fix the vulnerabilities. All
  users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.

## Workaround
There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 3.0.10.
