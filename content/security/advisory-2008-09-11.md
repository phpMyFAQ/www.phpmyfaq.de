## phpMyFAQ 2.x input sanitization errors (XSS)

                        **Issued on::** 2008-09-11
                        **Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 2.0.8
                        **Risk::** High
                        **Platforms::** all

                    The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a security issue that has been discovered in phpMyFAQ 2.0.

                    ## Description
                    phpMyFAQ relies on code similar to Popoon's externalinput.php to filter out potential XSS
                        attacks on user-supplied input. This filter, and the original, fail to fully sanitize user data.
                        In particular, this filter fails to protect against '/'s acting as spaces in both Microsoft
                        Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.

                    ## Solution
                    The phpMyFAQ Team has released a new phpMyFAQ version 2.0.8 which fixes these vulnerabilities.
                        All users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this
                        latest version.

                    ## Workaround
                    There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.0.8.
