## Execution of arbitrary PHP code in phpMyFAQ version 1.4 and 1.5

                            **Issued on::** 2005-06-29
                            **Software::** phpMyFAQ version 1.4 and 1.5
                            **Risk::** high
                            **Platforms::** all

                        The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a serious security issue that has been discovered in our
                            bundled library XML-RPC we use in phpMyFAQ 1.4 and 1.5.

                        ## Description
                        The vulnerability is caused due to an unspecified error, which can be exploited to execute
                            arbitrary PHP code via an application using the vulnerable library.

                        ## Impact
                        This issue allows for possible remote code execution.

                        ## Solution
                        The phpMyFAQ Team has released a new phpMyFAQ version 1.4.9 and 1.5.0 RC5, which incorporate
                            a fixed bundled library XML-RPC. All users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to
                            upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.

                        ## Workaround
                        As a temporary hotfix you can delete your xmlrpcs.php and xmlrpcs.php file in the directory
                            inc/ so that your FAQ will not easily allow execution of maliclius XML-RPC method calls.
