## Multiple vulnerabilities in phpMyFAQ

**Issued on::** 2026-02-27
**Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 4.0.17
**Risk::** High
**Platforms::** all

The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of security issues that'd been discovered in phpMyFAQ 4.1.0-RC.6, and earlier.

## Description

The WebAuthn prepare endpoint (/api/webauthn/prepare) creates new active user accounts without any authentication, 
CSRF protection, or configuration checks. This allows unauthenticated attackers to create unlimited user accounts even 
when registration is disabled.

## Solution

The phpMyFAQ Team has released the new phpMyFAQ versions 4.0.18 and 4.1.0-RC.7, which fix the vulnerability. All
users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.

## Workaround

There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 4.0.18 or 4.1.0-RC.7.

## Thanks

The phpMyFAQ team would like to thank **Offensive-AI** for the responsible disclosures of this vulnerability.
