## XSS vulnerabilities in phpMyFAQ

  **Issued on::** 2023-04-23
  **Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 3.1.13
  **Risk::** Medium
  **Platforms::** all

The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of multiple security issues that'd been discovered in phpMyFAQ 3.1.13 and
  earlier. phpMyFAQ contains cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

## Description
phpMyFAQ doesn't implement sufficient checks to avoid XSS when intercepting malicious content into FAQs.

## Solution
The phpMyFAQ Team has released the new phpMyFAQ version 3.1.14 which fixes these vulnerabilities. All
  users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.

## Workaround
There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 3.1.14.
