## Remote PHP Code Execution Vulnerability in phpMyFAQ 2.7.4 and earlier

                        **Issued on::** 2012-04-14
                        **Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 2.7.4
                        **Risk::** Critical
                        **Platforms::** all

                    The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a serious security issue that has been discovered in our
                        bundled ImageManager library we use in phpMyFAQ 2.7.

                    ## Description
                    The bundled ImageManager library allows injection of arbitrary PHP code to execute arbitrary PHP
                        code and upload malware and trojan horses.

                    ## Solution
                    The phpMyFAQ Team has released a new phpMyFAQ version 2.7.5, which incorporates a fixed bundled
                        ImageManager library. All users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon
                        as possible to this latest version.

                    ## Workaround
                    There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.7.5.

                    ## Credits
                    The phpMyFAQ Team would like to thank <strong>EgiX</strong> for discovering this vulnerability.
