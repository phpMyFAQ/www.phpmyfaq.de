## SQL injection vulnerability in phpMyFAQ version 1.4 and 1.5

                        **Issued on::** 2005-03-06
                        **Software::** phpMyFAQ version 1.4 and 1.5
                        **Risk::** medium
                        **Platforms::** all

                    The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a possible SQL injection vulnerability in phpMyFAQ version 1.4
                        and 1.5.

                    ## Description
                    phpMyFAQ lets public users add FAQ records to the database. The records will be saved into the
                        database but aren't visible by default.

                    ## Impact
                    Input passed to the username field in forum messages isn't properly sanitised before being
                        stored.

                    ## Solution
                    The phpMyFAQ Team has released a new phpMyFAQ version 1.4.7 and 1.5.0 RC2, which incorporate a
                        fix for the SQL injection vulnerability. All users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged
                        to upgrade to this latest version.

                    ## Workaround
                    There is no workaround except installing the new version.

                    ## Credits
                    The phpMyFAQ Team would like to thank Sven Michels of sectoor GmbH for discovering this SQL
                        injection vulnerability.
