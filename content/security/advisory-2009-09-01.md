## phpMyFAQ 2.0.x XSS vulnerability

                        **Issued on::** 2009-09-01
                        **Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 2.5.1
                        **Risk::** High
                        **Platforms::** all

                    The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a security issue that has been discovered in phpMyFAQ 2.x

                    ## Description
                    When using Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 or 7 phpMyFAQ doesn't sanitize a GET variable in the
                        search page correctly. With a properly crafted URL it is f.e. possible to inject HTML code into
                        the output of the error message, which could result in the leakage of domain cookies (f.e.
                        session identifiers).

                    ## Solution
                    The phpMyFAQ Team has released new phpMyFAQ versions 2.0.17 and 2.5.2 which fix the
                        vulnerability. All users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
                        possible to this latest version.

                    ## Workaround
                    There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.0.17 or 2.5.2.
