## SQL injection and remote code execution vulnerabilities in phpMyFAQ 1.6.x

                        **Issued on::** 2006-12-15
                        **Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 1.6.7
                        **Risk::** High
                        **Platforms::** all

                    The phpMyFAQ Team has learned about some vulnerabilities in the code that could be exploited in
                        phpMyFAQ 1.6.x.

                    ## Description
                    Through one of the vulnerabilities it is possible to gain the privilege for uploading files on
                        the server: currently no public exploit is available but two users already reported us to be
                        hacked and the <strong>r57shell</strong> script has been installed on their systems.

                    ## Solution
                    The phpMyFAQ Team has released the new phpMyFAQ version 1.6.8 which fixes these vulnerabilities.
                        All users of the affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to
                        this latest version.

                    ## Workaround
                    At the time of this advisory there's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 1.6.8.

                    ## Credits
                    The phpMyFAQ Team would like to thank Markus Kohlmeyer, for reporting us how his system has been
                        hacked, and Stefan Esser, for discovering all the other vulnerabilities.
