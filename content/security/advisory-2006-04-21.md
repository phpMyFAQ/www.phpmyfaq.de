                    The phpMyFAQ Team has learned about a vulnerability in PHP that can be exploited in phpMyFAQ

                    ## Description

                        these vulnerability. All users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon

                    ## Workaround
                    If it's possible you should upgrade your PHP version to 4.4.3 or 5.1.3 which also fixes the
                        problem.
