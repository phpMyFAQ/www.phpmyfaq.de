  earlier. An authentication bypass has been discovered in the phpMyFAQ application.
  This vulnerability allows attackers to take over accounts that do not have Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) configured.

  Specifically, the "secret" field for 2FA can be left as a blank string under some conditions, including fresh installations.
  The vulnerability exists in the handling of the 2FA token in the `index.php` and `TwoFactor.php` files.
