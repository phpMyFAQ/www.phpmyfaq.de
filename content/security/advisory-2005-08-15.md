## Remote PHP Code Injection Vulnerability in phpMyFAQ 1.4.x and 1.5.x

                        **Issued on::** 2005-08-15
                        **Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 1.4.10 and phpMyFAQ  <= 1.5.0 RC6
                        **Risk::** high
                        **Platforms::** all

                    The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a serious security issue that has been discovered in our
                        bundled library XML-RPC we use in phpMyFAQ 1.4 and 1.5.

                    ## Description
                    The bundled XML-RPC library allow injection of arbitrary PHP code into eval() statements. This
                        is caused by an improper handling of XMLRPC requests and responses that are malformed in a
                        certain way.

                    ## Solution
                    The phpMyFAQ Team has released a new phpMyFAQ version 1.4.11 and 1.5.0 RC7, which incorporate a
                        fixed bundled library XML-RPC. All users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade
                        as soon as possible to this latest version.

                    ## Workaround
                    As a temporary hotfix you can delete your xmlrpc.php and xmlrpcs.php file in the directory inc/
                        so that your FAQ will not easily allow execution of maliclius XML-RPC method calls.
