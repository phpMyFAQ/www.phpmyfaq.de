## phpMyFAQ 2.6.x XSS vulnerabilities

                        **Issued on::** 2010-09-28
                        **Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 2.6.8
                        **Risk::** High
                        **Platforms::** all

                    The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a security issue that have been discovered in phpMyFAQ 2.6.x

                    ## Description
                    phpMyFAQ doesn't sanitize some variables in different pages correctly. With a properly crafted
                        URL it is e.g. possible to inject JavaScript code into the output of a page, which could result
                        in the leakage of domain cookies (f.e. session identifiers).

                    ## Solution
                    The phpMyFAQ Team has released new phpMyFAQ version 2.6.9 which fix the vulnerability. All users
                        of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest
                        version.

                    ## Workaround
                    There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.6.9.

                    ## Credits
                    The phpMyFAQ Team would like to thank Yam Mesicka for reporting the vulnerability.
