  **Platforms::** all

The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a security issues that'd been discovered in phpMyFAQ 4.0.1 and
  earlier. A stored HTML injection vulnerability has been discovered in the phpMyFAQ application.

## Solution

  users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.

## Workaround
There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 4.0.2.
