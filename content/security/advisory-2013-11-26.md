                        The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a security issue that has been discovered in phpMyFAQ

                        ## Description
                        Secunia noticed while analysing the advisory that authenticated users with "Right to add
                            attachments" are able to exploit an already publicly known issue in the bundled Ajax File
                            Manager of phpMyFAQ version 2.8.3, which leads to arbitrary PHP code execution for
                            authenticated users with the permission "Right to add attachments".

                        ## Workaround
                        There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.8.3.
