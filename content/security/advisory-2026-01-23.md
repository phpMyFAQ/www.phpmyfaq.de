## Multiple vulnerabilities in phpMyFAQ

**Issued on::** 2026-01-23
**Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 4.0.16
**Risk::** Moderate
**Platforms::** all

The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of security issues that'd been discovered in phpMyFAQ 4.0.16 and earlier.

## Description

A logged‑in user without the permission to download files can download FAQ attachments. This is due to a permissive 
permission check in attachment.php that treats the mere presence of a right key as authorization and a flawed group/user 
logic expression.

Authenticated non‑admin users can call /api/setup/backup and trigger a configuration backup. 
The endpoint only checks authentication, not authorization, and returns a link to the generated ZIP.

Several public API endpoints return email addresses and non‑public records (e.g., open questions with isVisible=false).

## Solution

The phpMyFAQ Team has released the new phpMyFAQ versions 4.0.17 and 4.1.0-RC.3, which fix the vulnerabilities. All
users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.

## Workaround

There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 4.0.17 or 4.1.0-RC.3.

## Thanks

The phpMyFAQ team would like to thank **Brahim-Fouad Guia** for the responsible disclosures of these vulnerabilities.
