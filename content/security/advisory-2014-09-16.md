                        ## Description
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                phpMyFAQ 2.8.12 is containing a SQL Injection vulnerability through the restore
                                function. This functionality is only executable by admin users with special permissions.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The application containing cross site scripting and content spoofing vulnerabilities
                                through Flash files bundled with TinyMCE and Ajax FileManager plugins.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The bundled TinyMCE Editor (v3.5.11) containing a DOM based stored cross site scripting
                                vulnerability.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The "delete user" functionality of phpMyFAQ 2.8.12 is containing a CSRF vulnerability.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                An attacker can delete any open question through another CSRF vulnerability because of
                                the lack of a CSRF token.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The check on "download an attachment" permissions is not working correct, so that anyone
                                can download attachments.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                An admin having privilege to delete any FAQ multi-site primary instance.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The application containing an improper Captcha implementation, as a result an attacker
                                can replay the request to bypass the Captcha protections on forms.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Administrator is able to view information about specific user session with unfiltered
                                IPs and user agents.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        ## Solution
                        The phpMyFAQ Team has released phpMyFAQ version 2.8.13 which fixes the vulnerabilities. All
                            users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this
                            latest version.

                        ## Workaround
                        There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.8.13.
