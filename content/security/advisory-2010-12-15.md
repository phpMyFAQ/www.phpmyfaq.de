## phpmyfaq.de compromised

                        **Issued on::** 2010-12-15
                        **Software::** phpMyFAQ > 2.6.10
                        **Risk::** Critical
                        **Platforms::** all

                    The main server of the phpMyFAQ Project was compromised in an attack, allowing a rogue version
                        of the phpMyfAQ software to be uploaded and distributed from december 4th until december 15th.
                        The affected versions were phpMyFAQ 2.6.11 and 2.6.12, both zip and tar.gz package. The attacker
                        also changed the MD5 files.

                    ## Description
                    The attacker added a backdoor into the file inc/Faq.php in the method getTopTen(). The code was
                        base64 encoded and first sent an e-mail to a GMail address and added an entry in the faqconfig
                        table. With this entry, a backdoor was opened to include to include arbitrary PHP code.

                    ## Solution
                    The phpMyFAQ Team will release a new clean phpMyFAQ version 2.6.13. All users of affected
                        phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.

                    ## Workaround
                    If you use phpMyFAQ 2.6.11 or phpMyFAQ 2.6.12 downloaded after december 4th or before december
                        15th you should change the file inc/Faq.php as soon as possible.
