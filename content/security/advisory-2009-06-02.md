## phpMyFAQ 2.0.x XSS vulnerability

                        **Issued on::** 2009-06-02
                        **Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 2.0.14
                        **Risk::** High
                        **Platforms::** all

                    The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a security issue that has been discovered in phpMyFAQ 2.0.

                    ## Description
                    phpMyFAQ doesn't sanitize the error message in the admin login page. In case of a "bad login"
                        attempt with a properly crafted URL it is f.e. possible to inject HTML code into the output of
                        the error message, which could result in the leakage of domain cookies (f.e. session
                        identifiers).

                    ## Solution
                    The phpMyFAQ Team has released a new phpMyFAQ version 2.0.15 which fixes the vulnerability. All
                        users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest
                        version.

                    ## Workaround
                    There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.0.15.

                    ## Credits
                    The phpMyFAQ Team would like to thank Jan Hertsens and Rick G. Elliot (LiveOps Inc) for
