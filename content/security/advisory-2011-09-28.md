                        **Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 2.6.17
                        **Risk::** Medium

                    The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a security issue that has been discovered in phpMyFAQ 2.6.

                    ## Description
                    phpMyFAQ 2.6 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a direct request to a
                        .php file, which reveals the installation path in an error message, e.g. by lang/language_uk.php
                        and certain other files.

                    ## Solution
                    The phpMyFAQ Team has released a new phpMyFAQ version 2.6.18 which fixes these vulnerabilities.
                        All users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this
                        latest version.

                    ## Workaround
                    There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.6.18.
