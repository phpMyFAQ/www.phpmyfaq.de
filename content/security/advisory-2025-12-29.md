## Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) and unauthenticated config backup download vulnerability in phpMyFAQ

**Issued on::** 2025-12-29
**Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 4.0.15
**Risk::** High
**Platforms::** all

The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of security issues that'd been discovered in phpMyFAQ 4.0.15 and earlier.

## Description

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in an 
administrator’s browser by registering a user whose display name contains HTML entities (e.g., &lt;img ...&gt;). When 
an administrator views the admin user list, the payload is decoded server-side and rendered without escaping, resulting 
in script execution in the admin context.

An unauthenticated remote attacker can trigger generation of a configuration backup ZIP via POST /api/setup/backup and 
then download the generated ZIP from a web-accessible location. The ZIP contains sensitive configuration files 
(e.g., database.php with database credentials), leading to high-impact information disclosure and potential follow-on 
compromise.

## Solution

The phpMyFAQ Team has released the new phpMyFAQ versions 4.0.16 and 4.1.0-RC, which fix the vulnerabilities. All
users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.

## Workaround

There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 4.0.15 or 4.1.0-RC.

## Thanks

The phpMyFAQ team would like to thank **eclipse07077** for the responsible disclosures of this vulnerability.
