                        **Issued on::** 2005-11-18
                        **Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 1.5.3
                        **Risk::** High
                        **Platforms::** all

                    The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a security issue that has been discovered in phpMyFAQ 1.5.

                    ## Description
                    All vulnerabilities are exploitable by an anonymous user. All vulnerabilities are exploitable,
                        no matter if magic_quotes_gpc is turned on or off. The "thema", "username" and "usermail"
                        parameters are prone to cross-site scripting attacks in the "add content" page.

                    ## Solution
                    The phpMyFAQ Team has released a new phpMyFAQ version 1.5.4 which fixes these vulnerabilities.
                        All users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this
                        latest version.

                    ## Workaround
                    There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 1.5.4.
