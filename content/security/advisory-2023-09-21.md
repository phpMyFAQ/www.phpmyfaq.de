## XSS and cookie vulnerabilities in phpMyFAQ

**Issued on::** 2023-09-21
**Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 3.1.17
**Risk::** Medium
**Platforms::** all

The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of multiple security issues that'd been discovered in phpMyFAQ 3.2.0 and
earlier. phpMyFAQ contains cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The secure flag handling of cookies is buggy.

## Description

phpMyFAQ doesn't implement sufficient checks to avoid XSS when adding malicious content into FAQs, configuration, user
administration, and multi-site configuration.

## Solution

The phpMyFAQ Team has released the new phpMyFAQ versions 3.2.1 and 3.1.18, which fixes these vulnerabilities. All
users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.

## Workaround

There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 3.2.1 or 3.1.18.
