## Multiple vulnerabilities in phpMyFAQ

**Issued on::** 2018-09-02
**Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 2.9.10
**Risk::** Medium
**Platforms::** all

The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of some security issues that have been discovered in phpMyFAQ 2.9.10 and
earlier. phpMyFAQ contains cross-site request forgery, a CSV Injection and an insecure usage of microtime for
password-reset tokens.

## Description

phpMyFAQ does not implement sufficient checks to avoid CSRF and CSV injection for the reports generated in the admin
backend. For the CSRF and CSV injection you need administrator privileges to be executed. We also use microtime to
generate the tokens of new passwords.

## Solution

The phpMyFAQ Team has released the new phpMyFAQ versions 2.9.11 which fix the vulnerabilities. All users
of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.

## Workaround

There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.9.11.

## Thanks

The phpMyFAQ teams would like to thank Zeel Chavda for the CSRF and CSV injection. We want to thank all for the
responsible disclosure of these vulnerabilities.
