## phpMyFAQ 2.5.x XSS vulnerabilities

                        **Issued on::** 2009-12-01
                        **Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 2.5.4
                        **Risk::** High
                        **Platforms::** all

                    The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of multiple security issues that have been discovered in phpMyFAQ
                        2.5.x

                    ## Description
                    When using Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 or 7 phpMyFAQ doesn't sanitize various variables in
                        different pages correctly. With a properly crafted URL it is e.g. possible to inject JavaScript
                        code into the output of a page, which could result in the leakage of domain cookies (f.e.
                        session identifiers).

                    ## Solution
                    The phpMyFAQ Team has released new phpMyFAQ version 2.5.5 which fix the vulnerability. All users
                        of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest
                        version.

                    ## Workaround
                    There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.5.5.

                    ## Credits
                    The phpMyFAQ Team would like to thank Amol Naik for reporting the vulnerability.
