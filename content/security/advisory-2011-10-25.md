## Remote PHP Code Injection Vulnerability in phpMyFAQ 2.6.18 and 2.7.0

                        **Issued on::** 2011-11-25
                        **Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 2.6.18 and phpMyFAQ <= 2.7.0
                        **Risk::** Critical
                        **Platforms::** all

                    The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of a serious security issue that has been discovered in our
                        bundled ImageManager library we use in phpMyFAQ 2.6 and 2.7.

                    ## Description
                    The bundled ImageManager library allows injection of arbitrary PHP code via POST requests.

                    ## Solution
                    The phpMyFAQ Team has released a new phpMyFAQ version 2.6.19 and 2.7.1, which incorporates a
                        fixed bundled ImageManager library. All users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to
                        upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.

                    ## Workaround
                    There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.6.19 and phpMyFAQ 2.7.1.

                    ## Credits
                    The phpMyFAQ Team would like to thank <strong>EgiX</strong> for discovering this vulnerability.
