## Remote code execution vulnerability in phpMyFAQ 1.6.x

                        **Issued on::** 2007-02-18
                        **Software::** phpMyFAQ <= 1.6.9
                        **Risk::** High
                        **Platforms::** all

                    The phpMyFAQ Team has learned about a vulnerability in the code that could be exploited in
                        phpMyFAQ 1.6.x.

                    ## Description
                    Through the vulnerability it is possible to gain the privilege for uploading files on the server
                        when register_globals is activated: currently no public exploit is available but some users
                        already reported us to be hacked and the <strong>r57shell</strong> script has been installed on
                        their systems.

                    ## Solution
                    The phpMyFAQ Team has released the new phpMyFAQ version 1.6.10 which fixes the vulnerability.
                        All users of the affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to
                        this latest version.

                    ## Workaround
                    If it's possible for you set register_globals to off in your php.ini configuration settings.

                    ## Credits
                    The phpMyFAQ Team would like to thank François Maillet and Enrico Fischer (Powerserver-Germany
                        webHosting & DomainServices) for reporting the vulnerability, and Johannes Schlüter for
                        discovering and fixing the issue.
