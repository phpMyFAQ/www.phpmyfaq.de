**<a name="2"></a>2.Installation**

**<a name="2a"></a>2.a. Requirements for phpMyFAQ**

phpMyFAQ addresses a database system via PHP. In order to install it you will need a webserver that meets the following requirements:

*   **[PHP](http://www.php.net)**

        *   from version 4.3.3 (recommended: latest PHP 4.4 or latest PHP 5.2)
    *   register_globals = off (recommended)
    *   safe_mode = off (recommended)
*   **Webserver** ([Apache](http://httpd.apache.org) 1.3/2.0/2.2 or [lighttpd](http://www.lighttpd.net) 1.0+ or [IIS](http://www.microsoft.com/) 5.0+)
*   **Database server**

        *   [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) 4.x, 5.x with the PHP4 MySQL extension  (recommended: 5.0.x)
    *   [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) 4.1.x, 5.x with the PHP5 MySQLi extension (recommended: 5.0.x)
    *   [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) 7.2+, 8.x (recommended: 8.1.x)
    *   [Sybase](http://www.sybase.com)
    *   [Microsoft SQL Server](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/) 2000, 2005
    *   [IBM DB2 Universal Database](http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/db2/) 8.2.x, 9.1.x, [IBM Cloudscape](http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/cloudscape/), and [Apache Derby](http://db.apache.org/derby/)
    *   [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org) with PHP5
    *   [MaxDB](http://www.mysql.com/products/maxdb/) 7.5 or later (experimental)
    *   [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com) 8i or later (experimental)
    *   [Firebird](http://www.firebirdsql.org) / [Interbase](http://www.codegear.com/products/interbase) (experimental)
*   correctly set: access permissions, owner, group

You can only run phpMyFAQ successfully, when the PHP directive safe_mode is set to off, further constraints affect the directives open_basedir and disable_functions, which can be set in the central php.ini or the httpd.conf respectively.

In case PHP runs as module of the Apache, you will have to be able to do a chown on the files before installation. The files and directories must be owned by the Apache user.

You can determine which versions your webserver is running by creating a file called **info.php** with the following content:

    <pre>&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;</pre>

Upload this file to your webspace and open it using your browser. The installation-script checks which version of PHP is installed on your server. Should you not meet the requirements, you cannot start the installation process.

In case you have PHP below 4.3.3 installed you cannot use phpMyFAQ.

phpMyFAQ uses a WYSIWYG online editor. It uses a non-standard feature based on JavaScript implemented in Mozilla Firefox 0.7+ (any platform), Mozilla 1.3+ (any platform), Opera 9.0+ (any platform) and Internet Explorer 5.5+ for Windows, therefore the editor will only work in one of these browsers. You have to enable JavaScript for the Ajax based functions as well.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="2b"></a>2.b. Preparations**

Please unzip the downloaded archive on your harddisk.

You can modify the layout of phpMyFAQ using templates. A description of how this is done can be found [below](#6). Copy all unzipped files to your webserver in a directory using FTP. A good choice would be the directory **faq/**.

    **Important:**

    Writing permission for your script is needed in this directory to be able to configure the file **data.php** during installation. This is the case if you're running PHP as CGI or as mod_php with disabled safe-mode. The installation script will stop when your webserver isn't configured as needed.

It might help to set chmod 777 to the whole phpMyFAQ directory to avoid problems during the installation. If you're running a very restrictive mod_php installation you should keep the chmod 777 for the following files and directories even after the succesful installation:

*   the file **data.php** in the directory **inc/***   the directory **attachments/**
*   the directory **data/**
*   the directory **images/**
*   the directory **pdf/**
*   the directory **xml/**

All other directories shouldn't be world-writable for your own security.

The database user needs the permissions for CREATE, DROP, ALTER, INDEX, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and SELECT on all tables in the database.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="2c"></a>2.c. Install-Script**

Open your browser and type in the following URL:

    <pre>http://www.example.com/faq/install/installer.php</pre>

Substitute **www.example.com** with your actual domain name. When the site is loaded enter the address of your database server (e.g. db.provider.com), your database username and password as well as the database name. The datebase must be availible before running the installation script. You can leave the prefix-field empty. If you are planning on using multiple FAQs in one database you will have to use a tableprefix, though (i.e. _sport_ for a sports-FAQ, _weather_ for a weather-FAQ, etc.). Please note that only letters and an underline: "_" can be used as the prefix.

If your PHP was compiled with the LDAP extension you can add your LDAP information, too. You have to insert your LDAP informations, too.

When using multiple FAQs you need to install them independently into different directories (e.g. faq1/, faq2/. faq3/ etc.). In addition you can enter your language, default here is English. Furthermore you should register your name, your email address and - very importantly - your password. You must enter the password twice and it have to be at least six places long. Then click the button **"install"** to initialize the tables in your database.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="2d"></a>2.d. First Steps**

You can enter the public area of your FAQ by entering

    <pre>http://www.example.com/faq/index.php</pre>

into your browser's address field. Your FAQ will be empty and presented in the the standard layout.

To configure phpMyFAQ point your browser to

    <pre>http://www.example.com/faq/admin/index.php</pre>

Use the username **admin** and your selected password for your first login into the admin section.

Some variables that doesn't change regulary, they can be edited in the file _inc/constants.php_. You can change the

*   the time zone of your server (default: 0:00 hours)
*   the timeout in the admin section (default: 30 minutes)
*   the timeout warning popup in the admin section (default: 5 minutes)
*   the solution id start value (default: 1000)
*   the incremental value of the solution id (default: 1)
*   the number of records in the Top10 (default: 10)
*   the number of latest records (default: 5)
*   the number of open questions in the RSS feed (default: 50)
*   flag with which Latest and Topten RSS feeds will be forced to use the current PMF SEO URL schema (default: true)
*   flag with which Google sitemap will be forced to use the current PMF SEO URL schema (default: true)
*   flag with which Yahoo sitemap will be forced to use the current PMF SEO URL schema (default: true)
*   the number with which the Tags Cloud list is limited to (default: 50)
*   the number with which the Autocomplete list is limited to (default: 20)

**<a name="2e"></a>2.e. Notes regarding the search-function**

The boolean fulltext-search will only work with MySQL and if there are some entries in the database (5 or more). The term you are looking for should also not be in more than 50% of all your entries, or it will automatically be excluded from search. This is not a bug, but rather a feature of MySQL. Please remember that you need MySQL 4.1 or later to use the boolean fulltext search for languages like Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Korean or Japanese.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="2f"></a>2.f. Automatic content negotiation**

To set the default language in your browser you have to set a variable that gets passed to the web server. How this is done depends on the browser you are using.

*   Mozilla Firefox
Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> Edit Languages
*   Mozilla/Netscape 4.x and later versions<pre>Edit -> Preferences -> Navigator -> Languages</pre>
*   Safari
Safari uses the MacOS X system preferences to determine your preferred language:<pre>System preferences -> International -> Language</pre>
*   Opera
Most versions:<pre>File -> Preferences -> Languages</pre>Linux/*BSD versions 5.x and 6.x:<pre>File -> Preferences -> Document -> Languages</pre>
*   Internet Explorer
Windows:<pre>Tools or View or Extras -> Internet Options -> (General) Languages</pre>MacOS:<pre>Edit -> Preferences -> Web Browser -> Language/Fonts</pre>

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="2g"></a>2.g. PHP settings**

If you're able to edit the php.ini file, please check that the variable _file_upload = On_ is set; otherwise the file upload will not work for the attachments. You should disable the _safe_mode_ because it will cause trouble when you're trying to upload files or if you want to use the user tracking.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="2h"></a>2.h. Enabling mod_rewrite support**

_Apache Webserver_

If you want to enable the search engine optimization you have to rename the file _.htaccess to .htaccess in the root directory where your FAQ is located. Then you have to activate the mod_rewrite support in the admin backend in the configuration page.

_IIS Webserver_

If you want to enable the search engine optimization you have to rename the file _httpd.ini to httpd.ini in the root directory where your FAQ is located. Then you have to activate the mod_rewrite support in the admin backend in the configuration page.

_lighttpd Webserver_

If you want to enable the search engine optimization you have to copy the rewrite rules in the file _lighttpd.conf to your lighttpd.conf. Then you have to activate the mod_rewrite support in the admin backend in the configuration page.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="2i"></a>2.i. Enabling LDAP support**

If you're entered the correct LDAP information during the installation you have to enable the LDAP support in the configuration in the admin backend. After this action phpMyFAQ reads the full username and email address from LDAP and fills this information automatically into the input forms in the public frontend.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="2j"></a>2.j. PDF export**

Not every (X)HTML tag is supported by the PDF export. Currently we're supporting the following tags in the PDFs:

*   support for bold, italics, underlined text
*   support for images
*   basic support for tables
*   support for lists &lt;li&gt;
*   &lt;pre&gt; will be displayed using Courier font
*   support for &lt;br&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;  and &lt;p&gt;
*   support for &lt;hr&gt; and &lt;hr /&gt;
*   support for &lt;sup&gt; and &lt;sub&gt;

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="2k"></a>2.k. Firefox and IE7 search plugins**

phpMyFAQ 2.0.x provides search plugins for Mozilla Firefox 2 and Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 based on the OpenSearch specification. Every user in the frontend can install it. With an installed search plugin you can search through the phpMyFAQ installation with the search box in upper right corner of Mozilla Firefox 2 or Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="2l"></a>2.l. Static solution ID**

phpMyFAQ implements a static solution ID which never changes. This ID is displayed next to the question on a FAQ record page. You may think why do you need such an ID? If you have a record ID _1042_ it is now possible to enter only the ID _1024_ in the input field of the fulltext search box and you'll be automatically redirected to the FAQ record with the ID _1024_. By default the numbers start at ID _1000_ but you can change this value in the file _inc/constants.php_. You can also change the value of the incrementation of the static IDs.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="2m"></a>2.m. Spam protection**

phpMyFAQ 2.0 performs these three checks on public forms:

1.  Check against IP/Network address
2.  Check against banned words
3.  Check against the captcha code

The IP/Network addresses can be added or removed in the configuration panel in the administration backend. If you want to add banned words to phpMyFAQ, then you have to edit the file _inc/blockedwords.txt_. Please add only one word per line.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="4"></a>4. Frontend**

The phpMyFAQ frontend has a quite simple default layout. The header has the main links for the advanced search, add content, ask questions, open questions, help and contact. On the left side you see the main categories, the instant response page and the sitemap. You can also change the current language of the FAQ, use the search form or the login box if you have a valid user account. On the right side you see the Top 10 FAQ records and the five latest records. On the pages with the FAQ records you'll see the other records of the current category and the tagcloud if you're using tagging.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="4a"></a>4.a.Change languages**

As written above there's a select box for changing the current language. If you're visiting a phpMyFAQ powered FAQ, the current language will be the one you're browser is usring or the language which was selected by the administrator of the FAQ. If you change the language you'll see the categories and records of your chosen language. If there are no entries in this language you'll see no entries. If you're switching to languages with right to left text direction (for example Arabic, Hebrew or Farsi) the whole layout will be switching according to the text direction.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="4b"></a>4.b. RSS Feeds**

On the start page you can subscribe to three RSS feeds with the news of the FAQ, the Top 10 and the latest records available in the FAQ. On the page with the open user questions you can subscribe to the RSS feed with these questions. All feeds are compatible to the RSS 2.0 specification.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="4c"></a>4.c. Advanced search**

On the page with the advanced search you have more possibilities to find an entry. You can search over all language if you want to. It's alos possible to search only in one selected category. Additionally the link for the OpenSearch plugin is below the main search box.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="4d"></a>4.d. Instant Response**

The Instant Response is an Ajax-powered page with direct access to the whole FAQ database and the page will return the search results while you're typing into the input form. For performance reasons only the first 10 results will be displayed on the page. Please note that between every keypress there's a delay of 200ms.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="4e"></a>4.e. Add content**

On the _add content_ page it's possible for all users to add a new FAQ record. The users have to add a FAQ question, select a category, add an answer, and they have to insert their name and e-mail address. If the spam protection is enabled they have to enter the correct captcha code, too. New FAQ entries won't be displayed and have to be activated by an administrator.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="4f"></a>4.f. Ask questions**

On the _ask question_ page it's possible for all users to add a new question without an answer. The users have to add a question, select a category, and they have to insert their name and e-mail address. If the spam protection is enabled they have to enter the correct captcha code, too. By default new questions won't be displayed and have to be activated by an administrator.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="4g"></a>4.g. Open questions**

This page displays all open questions and it's possible for all users to add an answer for this question. The user will be directed to the [add content](#4e) page If the spam protection is enabled they have to enter the correct captcha code, too.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="4h"></a>4.h. Submit translation**

On every FAQ record page there's a select box for languages and a button to translate an existing FAQ record to another language. The translating user will be directed to a special [add content](#4e) page with the original entry and a stripped down WYSIWYG editor component. If the spam protection is enabled they have to enter the correct captcha code, too.

Please do not forget to add also a translated category, otherwise you won't be able to activate the translated entry.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="4i"></a>4.i. Digg it!**

On every FAQ record page there's a direct link to [digg.com](http://www.digg.com) there you can submit the FAQ entry.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="4j"></a>4.j. Internal references**

For better usability there are some helpful links below every FAQ record. If the administrator added tags to the records they will be displayed next to five (or more) related articles. The related articles are based on the content of the current FAQ entry. On the right side you'll see links to all entries of the current category and the complete tag cloud of the whole FAQ.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="5"></a>5. Administration**

The administration of phpMyFAQ is completely browser-based. The admin area can be found under this URL:

    <pre>http://www.example.com/faq/admin/index.php</pre>

If you have lost your password you can reset it. A new random password will be generated and sent to you via e-mail. Please change it after your successful login with the generated password.

After entering your username and password you can log into the system. On the startpage you can see the admin menu on the top, some statistics about visits, entries and comments in the middle of the page. At the bottom of the main admin page you'll see a button for version information. If you click on that button your version of phpMyFAQ will check the latest version number from our website www.phpmyfaq.de. We do not log anything in this process! You can switch the current language in the administration backend and you have an info box about the session timeout.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="5a"></a>5.a. User Administration**

phpMyFAQ 2 offers a flexible management of privileges (or rights) for different users in the admin area. It is possible to assign different priviledges to real people (represented by the term users). Those priviledges are very detailed and specific, so that you could allow a certain user to edit but not to delete an entry. It is very important to contemplate which user shall get which priviledges. You could edit an entry by completely deleting all content, which would be equivalent to deleting the whole entry. The number of possible users is not limited by phpMyFAQ.

Keep in mind that new users have no priviledges at all, you will have to assign them by editing the user's profile. The _admin_ user cannot be deleted, nor can the name be changed.

A user without any permission in the admin section can still get read access to categories and records. You can set the permissions on categories and records in the category and record administration frontends.

**<a name="5b"></a>5.b. Group Administration**

phpMyFAQ 2 also offers a flexible management of privileges (or rights) for different groups in the admin area. You can set permissions for groups in the same way like for users described in the topic above.

Please note that the permissions for a group are higher rated than the permissions on a user.

**<a name="5c"></a>5.c. Category Administration**

phpMyFAQ lets you create different categories and nested sub-categories for your FAQ. You can also re-arrange your categories in a different order. It is possible to use varius languages per category, too; there's also a frontend about all translated categories. For accessibility reasons you should add a small description for every category. If you add a new category, you can set the permissions for users and groups, and you can bind an administrator to that category. This is quite nice if you want to share the work in your FAQ between various admin users.

**<a name="5d"></a>5.d. Record Administration**

You can create entries directly in the admin area. Created entries are NOT published by default. All available entries are listed on the page "edit FAQs". By clicking on them the same interface that lets you create records will open up, this time with all the relevant data of the specific entry. The meaning of the fields is as follows:

*   **Category**

        The place in the FAQ hierarchy where this entry will be published depends on these settings. You can choose one or more categories where to store the entry. If you want to add a FAQ record to more than one category you have to select the categories with your mouse and press the CTRL key.
*   **Question**

        This is the question or headline of your entry.*   **Answer**
The content is an answer to the question or a solution for a problem. The content can be edited with the included WYSIWYG (**W**hat **Y**ou **S**ee **I**s **W**hat **Y**ou **G**et) editor when JavaScript is enabled. You can place images where you want with the integrated image manager. The editor provides the following key combinations:

        *   CTRL-A - select all
    *   CTRL-B - bold
    *   CTRL-I - italic
    *   CTRL-U - underline
    *   CTRL-S - strikethrough
    *   CTRL-L - justify left
    *   CTRL-E - justify center
    *   CTRL-R - justify right
    *   CTRL-J - justify full
    *   CTRL-1 .. CTRL-6 - headings (&lt;h1&gt; .. &lt;h6&gt;)
    *   CTRL-0 (zero) - clean content pasted from Word
*   **Keywords**

        Keywords are relevant for searching through the database. In case you didn't include a specific word in the entry itself, but it is closely related to the content you may wish to include it as a keyword, so the entry will come up as a search result. It is also possible to use non-related keywords so that a wrongly entered search will also lead to the right results.
*   **Tags**

        You can add some tags about the current entry here. An Ajax-based auto-completion method helps you while typing your tags.
*   **Author**

        It is possible to specify an author for your entry.
*   **E-Mail**

        It is possible to specify the author's e-mail for your entry, but the e-mail address won't be shown in the frontend.
*   **Language**

        You can select the language of your entry. By default the selected language saved in the configuration will be chosen. You can create entries in multiple languages like this: Write an article in English (or any other language) and save it. Now choose _edit records_ and edit your English entry. Change the theme, content and keywords and change language to, let's say Brazilian portuguese. _Save_ the entry. Now you can, when you click _edit records_, see both entries in your list, having the same id, yet different languages.
*   **Solution ID**

        Every entry generates automatically a so-called solution ID. All records can be accessed directly by putting this ID into the search box.
*   **Active?**

        If an entry is "active" it is visible in the public area and will be included in searches. Is it "deactivated" it will be invisible. Suggested entries are deactivated by default to prevent any abuse.
*   **Comments?**

        If you do not want to allow public comments for this entry you can disable the feature here.
*   **Revsion**

        Lika a wiki, phpMyFAQ 2 supports revisions of every entry. New revisions won't be created autmatically but you can create a new one if you click on "yes". The old revision will be stored in the database and the new current revision will be displayed in the public frontend. You can also bring back old revisions into the frontend if you select an old revision and save them as a new one.
*   **Permissions**

        If you add or edit a new entry, you can set the permissions for users and groups.
*   **Record expiration time window**

        If you need to you can set a time frame from one date to a second date when the FAQ entry should be valid and visible. Before and after this time frame the entry isn't visible and cannot be accessed.
*   **Date**

        Date of the last change.
*   **Changed?**

        This field is reserved for comments that can reflect what changes have been applied to a certain entry. This helps multiple admins to keep track of what happened to the entry over time. Any information entered here will remain invisible in the public area.
*   **Changelog**

        The changelog lists all previous changes, including user and date of change.

You can edit and delete all records as well. Please note that old revisions won't be deleted.

phpMyFAQ lets visitors contribute to the FAQ by asking questions. Every visitor is able to view these open questions in the public area, and may give an answer. If you wish to get rid of open questions you can do so using this section. Alternatively you can take over a question and answer it yourself and hereby add it to the FAQ.

There is also a search function that you can use to look for **a certain IP**, the **number of minimum actions** or **the date of a visit**.

**<a name="6"></a>6. Customising phpMyFAQ 2.0.x**

In phpMyFAQ 2.0.x code and layout are separated. The layout is based on several templates, that you can modify to suit your own needs. The most important files for phpMyFAQ's layout can be found in the directory _template/_. All original templates are valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional and we don't use tables for layout reasons.

**Note:** You can change the layout of the admin area using the CSS file _admin.css_.

[back to top](#top)

* * *

**<a name="6a"></a>6.a. The file template/index.tpl**

The default layout of phpMyFAQ is saved in the **index.tpl** file. This is a normal HTML-file including some variables in curly brackets, serving as placeholders for content.

Example:

    <pre>&lt;span class="useronline"&gt;{userOnline}&lt;/span&gt;</pre>

The template-parser of the FAQ converts the placeholder _{userOnline}_ to the actual number of visitors online.

You can change the template as you wish, but you may want to keep the original template in case something goes wrong. Theoretically you can use any editor for changing the templates, test using Dreamweaver were successful. Modifying the files with Microsoft Frontpage, Adobe GoLive or NetObjects Fusion may mess up the template, since they alter the source-code.

**<a name="6b"></a>6.b. The file template/style.css**

All formattings such as fonts and the like can be modified in the CSS-file **style.css**. The colors are defined in the file **colors.css**. More info can be found at [the official W3C website](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS).
